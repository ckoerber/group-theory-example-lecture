  <h2>Group Theory in Nuclear and Particle Physics Example Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    <em>These slides were presented in the weekly "Group Theory in Nuclear and Particle Physics" lecture (this was the 10th lecture) at Ruhr-University Bochum during the winter semster 21/22.</em>
    <em>The lecture is a masters level course for physicists and mathematicians.</em>
    <em>This page demonstrates how this framework was used.</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>These slides contain dynamic elements such as
      <ul>
        <li>a voice over (recorded during the digital "live" lecture)</li>
        <li><a href="http://0.0.0.0:8000/#/4/2">animated figures</a></li>
        <li><a href="/#/3/2">white-board like derivations in form of videos</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In particular, you can navigate using the arrow keys (&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, and &#8595;) and start/stop the voice over by pressing "<code>a</code>"
      <ul>
        <li><em>This presentation is two-dimensional, going right changes sections, going down brings more details</em></li>
        <li><em>Pressing "<code>?</code>" presents more controls over the slides</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They are based on the <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js framework</a>, were created using open-source tools, only, and are under version control. See also <ul>
