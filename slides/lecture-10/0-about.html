  <h2>Group Theory in Nuclear and Particle Physics Example Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    <em>These slides were presented in the weekly "Group Theory in Nuclear and Particle Physics" lecture (the 10th lecture) at Ruhr-University Bochum during the winter semester of 21/22. The lecture is a master's level course for physicists and mathematicians. This page demonstrates how this framework was used.</em>

  <ul>
    <li>These slides contain dynamic elements such as
      <ul>
        <li>a voice-over (recorded during the digital "live" lecture),</li>
        <li><a href="https://ckoerber.github.io/group-theory-example-lecture/#/4/2">animated figures,</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ckoerber.github.io/group-theory-example-lecture/#/3/2">white-board like derivations in the form of videos</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In particular, you can navigate using the arrow keys (&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, and &#8595;) and start/stop the voice-over by pressing "<code>a</code>"
      <ul>
        <li><em>This presentation is two-dimensional; going right changes sections, going down brings more details.</em></li>
        <li><em>Pressing "<code>?</code>" presents more controls over the slides.</em></li>
