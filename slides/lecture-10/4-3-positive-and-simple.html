  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p><em>So far we have seen how to construct many sub $su(2)$s for general simple Lie algebras. But how can we use those to find explicit representations or bases?</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is it possible to know how many roots are present in a general algebra?</li>
    <li>Do we need all of the roots to identify all states in a representation?</li>
    <li class="fragment">What is the notion of <i>positiveness</i> for root vectors? <br> <em>(i.e., what does it mean to apply raising and lowering operations in a multi-dimensional space?)</em></li>
    <li class="fragment">Does the order of applying multiple creation and annihilation operators matter?<br>And if so, how do we find the right orders?</li>
  </ul>
